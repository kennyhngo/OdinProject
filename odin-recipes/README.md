This project is assigned to test my skills of HTML.
This project will primarily focus on the basic foundations of creating:
* headers
* paragraphs
* links
* images
* unordered and ordered lists
  
Because CSS has not been introduced, this will be the barebones of the website with no pretty visuals and formatting.
